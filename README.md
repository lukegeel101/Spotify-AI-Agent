# Spotify-AI-Agent
Spotify AI Agent, better than Alexa!

The file app.py is all the code put together so you should be able to run everything from there. Just make sure to get a Spotify API key (it's free) and an OpenAI API key (not free but it's cheap)

If you have any questions feel free to email me geelluke@gmail.com or reach out to me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-geel/

I put a video on YouTube explaining and demoing the code. You can find it on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/@LukeGeel101
